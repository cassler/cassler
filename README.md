### âœ¨ Making neato internet magic since 1999. âœ¨

Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Darin Cassler. I build handcrafted software and web solutions so you don't just work smarter - you work less. Small, bespoke products that your team, your customers or your audience will actually love.

- ðŸŒ± I call [darin.co](https://darin.co) my home on the web.
- Check out my [NPM Packages](https://www.npmjs.com/~cassler)
- Here's a [MineSweeper clone](https://mono-next-demo.vercel.app/about) I made one afternoon.
